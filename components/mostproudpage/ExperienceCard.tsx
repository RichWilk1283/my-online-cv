        I was the first of my family to move away from our home region. I moved
        190 miles away while also taking on the daunting task of starting out in
        a new business. The Dalkeith Guest House has taken a lot of hard work,
        long hours and determination. It has been well worth it and provided an
        amazing life for me and my family. I am very proud of it. This
        experience has taught me how adaptable, resourceful and determined I am.
        Even in completely new situations.
