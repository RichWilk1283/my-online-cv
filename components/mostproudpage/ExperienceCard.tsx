        I was the first of my family to move away from our home region. I moved
        200 miles away while also taking on the daunting task of starting out in
        a new business. The Dalkeith Guest House has taken a lot of a lot of
        hard work, long hours and determination. It has been well worth it and
        provided an amazing life for me and my family. I am extremely proud of
        it.
