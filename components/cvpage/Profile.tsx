        Enthusiastic, curious and full of transferable skills, passionate about
        forging a new career in the tech world of software development. I am
        currently en-rolled on the Code: Cumbria boot camp course whilst also
        using resources such as Codecademy, Udemy, documentation sites to fuel
        my appetite to move into a role where I can use my strong sense of
        excellence, personal dedication to grow and challenge myself.

        With practical experience in JavaScript, PHP, C#, HTML and CSS,
        including libraries and frameworks like Laravel, React and .NET. My
        previous experiences have made me into a proactive thinker and natural
        problem solver, so I have created several projects aiming to include
        other aspects studied, such as SOLID principles, best practices,
        responsive design, SQL and databaseâ€™s.
