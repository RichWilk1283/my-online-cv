          Enthusiastic, curious and full of transferable skills, passionate
          about forging a new career in the tech world of software development.
          I am currently en-rolled on the Code: Cumbria boot camp course whilst
          also using resources such as Codecademy, Udemy, documentation sites to
          fuel my appetite to move into a role where I can use my strong sense
          of excellence, personal dedication to grow and challenge myself.

        <p>
          With practical experience in JavaScript, PHP, C#, HTML and CSS,
          including libraries and frameworks like Laravel, React and .NET. My
          previous experiences have made me into a proactive thinker and natural
          problem solver, so I have created several projects aiming to include
          other aspects studied, such as SOLID principles, best practices,
          responsive design, SQL and database&apos;s.
