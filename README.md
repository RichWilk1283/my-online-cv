Using NEXT.js I have created a online CV and portfolio for myself to showcase projects I have worked on/created.

The home/landing page gives a little bit of a background story and some generalised (list) skills and navigation links for the other pages. I have then created pages for my CV, Portfolio projects, Resources I have found useful and finally a page for the project I am most proud of.

As an occasional perfectionist I have a few things I would like to tweak or add:
- A selective version of my CV where people can choose from selection boxes the parts of my CV they are interested in.
- I will also always look to refactor my code to make it CLEAN.
